The Stock Prediction project focused on forecasting the movement of Hyundai stock by leveraging historical data from the HyundaiStock.csv file.

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, known for its ability to capture sequential patterns in time-series data, was developed to analyze the temporal dependencies within the stock's historical performance. The LSTM model utilized past stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant features to make predictions about future stock movements. Following extensive training and validation, the model was applied generate predictions for Hyundai stock. 

To visually assess the model's accuracy, a comparative image titled "Actual & Predicted Stock image.png" was produced. This image serves as a visual representation of the model's performance, highlighting the distinctions between the actual stock movements and the predictions made by the LSTM model, offering valuable insights for investors and analysts in understanding the stock's behavior over time.
